What could be the benefits of emptiness in the Western society and how we understand things?</h4><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Learning from new cultures and their traditions bring endless amount of inspiration and provides new perspectives to look at the world. Marcel Proust said, "There is a beauty in being surrounded by the foreign - seeing things from a new perspective, with new eyes". I believe that our personal cultural values and background hugely influences the way we perceive the world and that opening oneself to a different cultural tradition is always beneficial. For a long time already I have been drawn to Japanese culture. During my exchange in Aalto University, Helsinki, I spent most of my semester following Japan related courses such as Japanese watercolor woodcut, Ukiyo-e, bookbinding and packaging design. One of my professors inspired me for this thesis by mentioning a concept from the East that looks at the world in a quite opposing way as we do in most of the Western world. Reading more about it turned my world upside down. To begin with, the traditional Japanese ideas of aesthetics portray an exact opposite of Western, especially American, ideal of the ultimate beauty. In most of the Western world the conventional beauty is something monumental, durable and spectacular whereas in Japan beauty lies on simplicity and subtlety and on the banal everyday matters. The core of Japanese aesthetics is simplicity; emptiness most specifically. Emptiness and nothingness is seen as full of meaning and that everything either originates from it or evolves towards it. Oddly, in the Western word this concept is not much researched and we do not even have a word or a term for it. In fact, in the West, nothingness usually has negative connotations. In Japanese they call this concept Ma and it describes void and nothingness. Personally I find a lot of the Japanese ideas interesting, because even though they are ancient ideas, they are still very relevant today. It is interesting to how Japan, being one of the most technologically developed countries, and still have a prevailing traditional side and how contemporary design is able to use and updated versions of the traditional ideas. I want to research why is it that simplicity is so powerful and inspiring. Japanese graphic designer and author Kenya Hara states that "today, we seem to be experiencing a rationalization of the senses. The art of refinement has been half-forgotten, and attentiveness to detail, absorption, and slow engagement are neglected". This applies to today's world, with the overwhelming and constantly accelerating consumer and material culture, fast paced lifestyles and that we tend to neglect and take the things around us for granted. The contemporary design aesthetics including flashy Internet glitch art are becoming constantly more extravagant and overwhelming and it feels as if our aesthetic values are flattened. Thereforem in today’s society, we need more aesthetic sensibility and more reflective ways of looking at the world. Appreciation of the mundane and the subtle could serve as the perfect remedy to the hectic, digital lives of a contemporary man. Instead of striving constantly for perfection, which is anyway impossible to reach, and clean mathematical symmetries we could use a new set of mind starting from appreciation of things we already have around us and serve as “awakening of our senses” as the Japanese designer Kenya Hara would say and that way we could become more conscious of our surroundings and the things we take for granted on everyday basis.</p><p>I will investigate the qualities and values of traditional Japanese aesthetic concepts of ultimate simplicity and analyze its presence and significance in contemporary design. I want to research where these aesthetic values are originating from; how did the discovery of simple beauty come about and what makes it so unique? This research will analyze these mattesr in context to the work of a contemporary designer Kenya Hara. By analyzing "Void" by an architect Tapio Periainen, I would also like to explore the importance of simplicity and emptiness from an ecological point of view against our wasteful habits of consumption and present ideas of how could Western world benefit from the ultimate simplicity?  </p><h4>Chapter 2</h4><p>The influences from both East and West have shaped the modern Japanese culture. It has a predominant mix of elements from the West, but still manages to contain established and distinctive traditional cultural aesthetics that are deeply rooted in the history, starting from the Heian era. "During the Heian era, Japan rejuvenated its focus on the natural world, embracing its unpredictable and instable nature and adopting sympathy to and appreciation for nature." Kenya Hara explains that for Japan, minimalism is the most comfortable way to face the world. The numerous concepts for Japanese aesthetics depict a different kind of beauty, often found in unexpected forms.  Most notably, Wabi-sabi represents rural and desolate beauty and “Ma”, an empty and formless beauty and the ultimate simplicity.  Wabi-sabi describes the aesthetics as refined simplicity and imperfection (wabi) and the celebration of that which is crude, faded and dark and hidden beauty (sabi) and it is about acceptation that life is only temporary and momentary. According to Wabi-Sabi, beauty can be found in the most unconventional, minor and hidden matters. “Wabi-Sabi is the beauty of the imperfect, impermanent, incomplete, modest, humble and the unconventional. Wabi-sabi objects are earthy, simple, unpretentious and made out of natural materials.” The Wabi-Sabi ideas are closely linked to Zen Buddhist thoughts but also can be traced to the earliest examples of Japanese literature. An example of Wabi-Sabi aesthetics can be seen, for example, in sakura leaves withering away, in the mundane every day objects, and things so subtle. Wabi-sabi is simple, but it is the opposite of Modernism. Wabi-sabi art is natural and may be temporary, where as modernism strives for man-made and enduring things. "Wabi-sabi is not about gorgeous flowers, majestic trees, or bold landscapes. It is about the minor and the hidden, the tentative and the ephemeral: things so subtle and evanescent that they are invisible to the vulgar eyes."</p><p>Emptiness is the basic concept of Japanese aesthetics. A Finnish architect Tapio Periainen explains the meaning of Ma by being the pure and essential void between all things. It sees nothingness as the center and origin of everything and a space towards things evolve and come from. Nothingness is the ultimate simplicity. This mentality is quite confusing to Westerns, because it is a complete opposite way of looking at the world. In the West an empty space is just an empty space, and there is no such concept like ma to describe it. An empty room is in fact not empty; it is a space full of possibilities. To describe the meaning of Ma, Periäinen uses the Japanese flag as an example. As known, the flag has a red circle in the middle and nothing around it. “The presence of MA is what makes the minimalism of a Japanese tatami room so peaceful. MA in essence is what makes minimalism possible. For example, it is the purposeful pauses in speech, which make the words stand out, and it is the quiet time we need to make our busy lives meaningful. It is the silence between the notes, which make the music, and MA is what creates the peace of mind we all need, so that there is room for our thoughts to exists properly. Ma is manifest in Japanese living architecture, garden design, music, Ikebana flower arrangements, calligraphy and poetry. However, Ma is not just a philosophical and artistic concept, but it is present in all aspects of Japanese daily life." Emptiness can be seen especially in the Japanese houses and their ability to eliminate all what is unnecessary. To the eyes of a Westerner, Japanese houses seem extremely modest; small space, functional with very minimal furniture with lots of emptiness. As an example, there were no beds and very little shelves or in some cases none at all. People sleep on tatami mats, which in the morning would be placed in the closets and the room would have more space to do daily things. Most importantly, this kind of ultimate, almost primitive, simplicity can be seen in the Japanese tearooms ceremonies. A Japanese traditional tearoom is a completely empty room, except for the things that may be placed there temporarily, such as a flower arrangement, to suit the mood.</p> <p>In the West appreciation of simplicity exists only for a little amount of time compared to Japan. It seems as if we need to have all this material in our surroundings to fill the void and to create meaning in our lives. This can be seen especially in Western interiors, where we have the need to cover our walls with paintings and frames and all sorts of other decorations. Is the fear of void built into all people, or is it a phobia brought about by the development of the conception of the world? This fear can be very clearly observed in Western interior design where the walls are filled with paintings and pictures and tables with small objects, as well as in Islamic or other oriental buildings and prehistoric objects. In the past we needed this kind of extravagancy to demonstrate the power of the king or an emperor. Japanese culture is partly an exception to this: the space of living housing and interior decoration is based on void, which is seen as a positive quality. The high contrast between technology and nature, and the contrast between Western consumer influence and the pure Japanese traditions is very intriguing. Immense cities such as Tokyo and Osaka are tremendously busy and filled with material glory, but when entering the rural countryside’s or temples in places like Kyoto or Nara, one is surrounded by serenity and peacefulness. The Japanese have a quite humble and traditional architecture and way of life. Even though the contrast between the urban and the rural is so distinct, there is something about the opposing elements that seem to fit perfectly and complement each other's and form a harmonious blend of the contrasts. For instance, the various temples and gardens spread around the urban areas still demonstrate the Japanese consciousness of her relationship with nature. The environment that surrounds these manmade temple spaces enhances the unnatural qualities—without nature they would simply be cold, unearthly structures isolated from their surroundings. Lauren Prusinski states that “the Japanese have a keen eye for their surroundings and have effectively mended ancient aesthetics with modern advancement postponed to their natural roots by highlighting rather than withdrawing their eternal presence in society."</p><h5>Chapter 3</h5><p>The traditional aesthetics of emptiness and the ultimate simplicity are very visible in the contemporary Japanese design. Rem Koolhaas stated that modernity would kill all the cultural traditions. Therefore Japanese design is very unique in a sense that it uses the old traditional ideology and puts it into a new context. Kenya Hara (1958) is a Japanese graphic designer, a curator and the art director of Japanese house brand Muji. He is also a teacher at the Musashino Art University, Tokyo. What makes Hara really valuable as a Japanese designer is his ability to articulate a clear philosophy about Japanese design that is sensitive to the present as much as it is to the past. He is the future of Japanese design. He believes that Asian countries have a key cultural resource that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. He says that "Lifestyle has value in Asia". "The Swiss have their cheese, the French their wine, but Hara’s future Japan will be based on the export of a way of life." Hara's design aesthetics are deeply related to the basic concept of Japanese aesthetics of emptiness. One of Hara’s books "White" is utterly dedicated on this subject. It explores the essence of white, which is closely related to the origin of Japanese aesthetics that symbolizes simplicity and subtlety. The central concepts discussed in "White" are emptiness and the absolute void. White and emptiness are closely intertwined and the concept if empty space brings those two things together. In his captivatingly light text on the concept of “white,”Kenya Hara counters this tendency. His personal journey through concepts, objects, and practices such as emptiness, paper, and the Japanese tea ceremony not only opens up a field of heightened nuance and refinement. By melding everyday observations with reflections on Japanese aesthetics and sensitivity, he also amplifies the need to critically revise our understanding of the senses. This important little book thus challenges the simplifications that inform much present day thought concerning what can be felt, experienced, and emotionally negotiated."</p><p>Hara believes that a good design creates another way of looking at something and "never looking at a plate or a cup in quite the same way againT. Hara views this kind of thought process as an awakening"t hat deepens our understanding of the objects in question. “This is what I mean when I say design should make the known become unknown." Hara’s work centers questions such as what would the world look like built at a nonhuman scale? What could common daily products become if they were redesigned? How can we design for all five senses? Hara’s work "what do macaroni and architecture have in common?" does exactly that. Hara sees graphic design as a form of communication. Hara puts emphasis on the value of emptiness in communication. He writes about the power of non-verbal communication such as a nod or eye contact that can convey so much. Japanese way of communication is full of emptiness; subjects of sentences are often left unsaid. Words are not always necessary in a conversation. The Western style of communication is more direct and in most countries, especially in the US, find a silence in a conversation rather awkward and therefore they have a need to keep the conversation going. Hara views people reaching a harmony in silence to be a highly refined level of communication. Listening is a crucial part of effective communication, and this applies also to design; "a Good communication has the distinction of being able to listen to each others, rather than to press one's opinion onto the opponent." His work supports this ideology clearly. A good design should not impose ideas and opinions onto its viewer; instead it should leave room for interpretation and the viewer to experience the work. “Hara compares this kind of communication with an empty container. In visual communication, there are equally signals whose signification is limited, as well as signals or symbols such as the red circle on the Japanese flag, which is like an empty container - permit every signification and do not limit imagination". Hara points out that by removing all the decorations and everything that is unnecessary, the design does not become poorer, but more magnificent. This view is directly linked to the traditional ideas of refined simplicity and the complete lack of everything unnecessary.</p><p>Kenya Hara is the founder and an art director of the Japanese "no brand" Muji. Muji is the biggest export and internationally most well know Japanese house brand selling consumer and household goods. Muji's aesthetics and ideology is directly connected to the Japanese concept of simplicity. It is distinguished by its minimalism and respect towards nature. It emphases on recycling and avoids waste in production and packaging. It also emphases on no-logo or "no-brand" policy which means that only a little amount of money is used for marketing and advertisement.  Muji's design style has been described to have "mundanity, and being "no-frills" and “minimalist” and also as Bauhaus-style. Muji’s product design, brand identity, is based around the selection of materials, efficient manufacturing processes and minimal packaging. Muji proucts have a limited colour range that is very natural. The image seen on pretty much summarizes the ideology of Muji. It is a man standing in a great emptiness. He looks so tiny and humble amongst the void, which fits in with their ideology that man is not the center of the world, but equal to everything. Hara curated a numerous of exhibitions, one being "HAPTIC_Awakening the senses (2004) demonstrated through contemporary designs. The limp remote control produced for the Haptic Exhibition shows a unique approach of looking at an ordinary object in a new light. The designer was approached by Panasonic the electrical appliance manufacture to design a remote control that when switched off droops as if it were dead, similar to Salvador Dali surreal painting style. The material used for the production was unusual and appealed to the sense of touch in human. When I saw this, many questions and assumptions were going through my mind as to how it would feel and how its functions would tick the entire box compared to other remote control that has been produced initially. "He makes it clear "Exformation" doesn't mean making known, but understanding how little we know. I am interested in dealing with how information is passed across through a simple object. Objects that holds thought (idea / thinking) contributes to how communication travels. </p><p>"RE-DESIGN daily products of the 21st Century" is another of Hara's exhibitions. It shows how daily life could serve as a great source for design. 32 designers were to design objects that we use on a daily basis. These objects included toilet paper, tea bag, matches, and stamps etc. and the designers redesigned these objects to create a new experience and new ways to use them. Some of the objects were made to make our daily lives more beautiful and our daily routines more enjoyable. Some objects did the opposite; in fact they became harder to use in order to convey a serious message. This happened with the redesign of the toilet paper for example. The hole in the paper roll was cut to be a square shape instead of a circle, which made it difficult to roll. This change is very subtle but changes the meaning of the object; instead of being just a toilet paper, it now serves as a reminder of our wasteful and unsustainable habits and that we should slow down consumption of i.e. paper. The redesign of the matches were also designed to remind us of the diminishing forest. These redesigned products are all about preservation and renewal by making simple, yet thoughtful alterations. The chocolate bar may seem at first just like a normal cute pattern, however in the end because of the cut of the pattern, you will end up eating less chocolate; and therefore less calories. This reminds the audience to cut down sugar consumption, because of the numerous underlying health hazards.</p><img src=http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6mx755x5M1qaafvu.jpg>	</body></html>
