What could be the benefits of emptiness in the Western society and how we understand things?</h3><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Learning from new cultures and their traditions bring endless amount of inspiration and provides new perspectives to look at the world. Marcel Proust said, "There is a beauty in being surrounded by the foreign - seeing things from a new perspective, with new eyes". I believe that our personal cultural values and background hugely influences the way we perceive the world and that opening oneself to a different cultural tradition is always beneficial. For a long time already I have been drawn to Japanese culture. During my exchange in Aalto University, Helsinki, I spent most of my semester following Japan related courses such as Japanese watercolor woodcut, Ukiyo-e, bookbinding and packaging design. One of my professors inspired me for this thesis by mentioning a concept from the East that looks at the world in a quite opposing way as we do in most of the Western world. Reading more about it turned my world upside down. To begin with, the traditional Japanese ideas of aesthetics portray an exact opposite of Western, especially American, ideal of the ultimate beauty. In most of the Western world the conventional beauty is something monumental, durable and spectacular whereas in Japan beauty lies on simplicity and subtlety and on the banal everyday matters. The core of Japanese aesthetics is simplicity; emptiness most specifically. Emptiness and nothingness is seen as full of meaning and that everything either originates from it or evolves towards it. Oddly, in the Western word this concept is not much researched and we do not even have a word or a term for it. In fact, in the West, nothingness usually has negative connotations. In Japanese they call this concept Ma and it describes void and nothingness. Personally I find a lot of the Japanese ideas interesting, because even though they are ancient ideas, they are still very relevant today. It is interesting to how Japan, being one of the most technologically developed countries, and still have a prevailing traditional side and how contemporary design is able to use and updated versions of the traditional ideas. I want to research why is it that simplicity is so powerful and inspiring. Japanese graphic designer and author Kenya Hara states that "today, we seem to be experiencing a rationalization of the senses. The art of refinement has been half-forgotten, and attentiveness to detail, absorption, and slow engagement are neglected". This applies to today's world, with the overwhelming and constantly accelerating consumer and material culture, fast paced lifestyles and that we tend to neglect and take the things around us for granted. The contemporary design aesthetics including flashy Internet glitch art are becoming constantly more extravagant and overwhelming and it feels as if our aesthetic values are flattened. Thereforem in today’s society, we need more aesthetic sensibility and more reflective ways of looking at the world. Appreciation of the mundane and the subtle could serve as the perfect remedy to the hectic, digital lives of a contemporary man. Instead of striving constantly for perfection, which is anyway impossible to reach, and clean mathematical symmetries we could use a new set of mind starting from appreciation of things we already have around us and serve as “awakening of our senses” as the Japanese designer Kenya Hara would say and that way we could become more conscious of our surroundings and the things we take for granted on everyday basis.</p></div><p>I will investigate the qualities and values of traditional Japanese aesthetic concepts of ultimate simplicity and analyze its presence and significance in contemporary design. I want to research where these aesthetic values are originating from; how did the discovery of simple beauty come about and what makes it so unique? This research will analyze these mattesr in context to the work of a contemporary designer Kenya Hara. By analyzing "Void" by an architect Tapio Periainen, I would also like to explore the importance of simplicity and emptiness from an ecological point of view against our wasteful habits of consumption and present ideas of how could Western world benefit from the ultimate simplicity?  </p><h3>Chapter 2</h3><p>The influences from both East and West have shaped the modern Japanese culture. It has a predominant mix of elements from the West, but still manages to contain established and distinctive traditional cultural aesthetics that are deeply rooted in the history, starting from the Heian era. "During the Heian era, Japan rejuvenated its focus on the natural world, embracing its unpredictable and instable nature and adopting sympathy to and appreciation for nature." Kenya Hara explains that for Japan, minimalism is the most comfortable way to face the world. The numerous concepts for Japanese aesthetics depict a different kind of beauty, often found in unexpected forms.  Most notably, Wabi-sabi represents rural and desolate beauty and “Ma”, an empty and formless beauty and the ultimate simplicity.  Wabi-sabi describes the aesthetics as refined simplicity and imperfection (wabi) and the celebration of that which is crude, faded and dark and hidden beauty (sabi) and it is about acceptation that life is only temporary and momentary. According to Wabi-Sabi, beauty can be found in the most unconventional, minor and hidden matters. “Wabi-Sabi is the beauty of the imperfect, impermanent, incomplete, modest, humble and the unconventional. Wabi-sabi objects are earthy, simple, unpretentious and made out of natural materials.” The Wabi-Sabi ideas are closely linked to Zen Buddhist thoughts but also can be traced to the earliest examples of Japanese literature. An example of Wabi-Sabi aesthetics can be seen, for example, in sakura leaves withering away, in the mundane every day objects, and things so subtle. Wabi-sabi is simple, but it is the opposite of Modernism. Wabi-sabi art is natural and may be temporary, where as modernism strives for man-made and enduring things. "Wabi-sabi is not about gorgeous flowers, majestic trees, or bold landscapes. It is about the minor and the hidden, the tentative and the ephemeral: things so subtle and evanescent that they are invisible to the vulgar eyes."</p><p>Emptiness is the basic concept of Japanese aesthetics. A Finnish architect Tapio Periainen explains the meaning of Ma by being the pure and essential void between all things. It sees nothingness as the center and origin of everything and a space towards things evolve and come from. Nothingness is the ultimate simplicity. This mentality is quite confusing to Westerns, because it is a complete opposite way of looking at the world. In the West an empty space is just an empty space, and there is no such concept like ma to describe it. An empty room is in fact not empty; it is a space full of possibilities. To describe the meaning of Ma, Periäinen uses the Japanese flag as an example. As known, the flag has a red circle in the middle and nothing around it. “The presence of MA is what makes the minimalism of a Japanese tatami room so peaceful. MA in essence is what makes minimalism possible. For example, it is the purposeful pauses in speech, which make the words stand out, and it is the quiet time we need to make our busy lives meaningful. It is the silence between the notes, which make the music, and MA is what creates the peace of mind we all need, so that there is room for our thoughts to exists properly. Ma is manifest in Japanese living architecture, garden design, music, Ikebana flower arrangements, calligraphy and poetry. However, Ma is not just a philosophical and artistic concept, but it is present in all aspects of Japanese daily life." Emptiness can be seen especially in the Japanese houses and their ability to eliminate all what is unnecessary. To the eyes of a Westerner, Japanese houses seem extremely modest; small space, functional with very minimal furniture with lots of emptiness. As an example, there were no beds and very little shelves or in some cases none at all. People sleep on tatami mats, which in the morning would be placed in the closets and the room would have more space to do daily things. Most importantly, this kind of ultimate, almost primitive, simplicity can be seen in the Japanese tearooms ceremonies. A Japanese traditional tearoom is a completely empty room, except for the things that may be placed there temporarily, such as a flower arrangement, to suit the mood.</p> <p>In the West appreciation of simplicity exists only for a little amount of time compared to Japan. It seems as if we need to have all this material in our surroundings to fill the void and to create meaning in our lives. This can be seen especially in Western interiors, where we have the need to cover our walls with paintings and frames and all sorts of other decorations. Is the fear of void built into all people, or is it a phobia brought about by the development of the conception of the world? This fear can be very clearly observed in Western interior design where the walls are filled with paintings and pictures and tables with small objects, as well as in Islamic or other oriental buildings and prehistoric objects. In the past we needed this kind of extravagancy to demonstrate the power of the king or an emperor. Japanese culture is partly an exception to this: the space of living housing and interior decoration is based on void, which is seen as a positive quality. The high contrast between technology and nature, and the contrast between Western consumer influence and the pure Japanese traditions is very intriguing. Immense cities such as Tokyo and Osaka are tremendously busy and filled with material glory, but when entering the rural countryside’s or temples in places like Kyoto or Nara, one is surrounded by serenity and peacefulness. The Japanese have a quite humble and traditional architecture and way of life. Even though the contrast between the urban and the rural is so distinct, there is something about the opposing elements that seem to fit perfectly and complement each other's and form a harmonious blend of the contrasts. For instance, the various temples and gardens spread around the urban areas still demonstrate the Japanese consciousness of her relationship with nature. The environment that surrounds these manmade temple spaces enhances the unnatural qualities—without nature they would simply be cold, unearthly structures isolated from their surroundings. Lauren Prusinski states that “the Japanese have a keen eye for their surroundings and have effectively mended ancient aesthetics with modern advancement postponed to their natural roots by highlighting rather than withdrawing their eternal presence in society."</p><img src=http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6mx755x5M1qaafvu.jpg>	</body></html>
